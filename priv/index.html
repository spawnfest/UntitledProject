      HTMX gives you access to create dynamic applications without having to learn all the nastyness
      and complication that comes with modern javascript.  Couple this with the BEAM alien technology
      of Lisp Flavored erlang, and you have a combinion that can't be stopped.

      When talking to a web server, there are a number of "HTTP" verbs, (GET PUT POST PATCH DELETE, ETC)
      that have been only available to AJAX requests, We the people say NO MORE ! We want the these
      verbs to be used by the hypermedia itself, connecting the verbs directly to HTML elements.
      </p>

      <p>
      This may seem a bit strange, how can you have this kind of power !?
