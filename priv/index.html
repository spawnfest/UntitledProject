    <b>Why backend is the new frontend.</b>

      HTMX gives you access to create dynamic applications without having to learn all the nastyness
      and complication that comes with modern javascript.  Couple this with the BEAM alien technology
      of Lisp Flavored erlang, and you have a combinion that can't be stopped.

        Before you dive down this rabbit hole, I start with a quote from Morpheus:
      </p>

        <div class="pl-10 underline decoration-pink-500 py-5">
          You have to understand. Most people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured and
          so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.
        </div>

      <p class="py-5">
        Individuals can become defensive when a new technology obsoletes or challenges a thought where they have invested time money or energy. There is a natural resistance to change, people are comfortable with what they know. Fear of the unknown can make individuals defensive, overwhelmed or uncertain. Investing significant time, money, or effort into  technology can make them defensive and reluctance to embrace the advantages of the new, despite its potential benefits.
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
        I dont want to debate the merits of frameworks, I do however want to introduce how simple and elengant
        this library is, and how so much can be done without writing javascript.
      </p>

      <b>Whats the big deal ?</b>

      <p class="py-5">
      When your browser talks to to a web server, it uses one of "HTTP" verbs,
      (GET PUT POST PATCH DELETE, ETC).  The HTML standard (even HTML 5) limits the browser
      to JSON being allowed to make these requests.
      <p>

      <p class="py-5">
      When you think about it, there isnt a good reason for HTML to not support these extended verbs,

      We the people say NO MORE ! We want the these verbs to be used by the hypermedia itself,
      connecting the verbs directly to HTML elements.
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
      This may seem a bit foreign the first time you encounter this, how can you have this kind of power.
      Who would I want this ? Buckle up because its a bumpy ride.
      </p>

        <b class="py-5">Motiviation</b>

        <ol class="py-5 list-disc">
          <li>Why should only a and form be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
          <li>Why should only click & submit events trigger them?</li>
          <li>Why should only GET & POST methods be available?</li>
          <li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="py-5">
      By removing these arbitrary constraints, htmx completes HTML as hypertext.
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
      Why does this matter ? Because almost all of the actions you want to do from the
      web client to the server are http verbs, previous locked up behind javascript and json.
