	HTMX AND LFE
    </h1>
    <b>Setting up your HTML.</b>

    <div class="py-5">

      <p class="py-5">
        In the introduction, I talked about not having to write javascript.  Which is mostly true,
        we still however need to include some javascript to supercharge our standard elements. 
        The first step is to include the HTMX script inside the  &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tags
        of your HTML document.
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
        At the time of writing the most current is: 
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
	   &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.6&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
        Without this the extra attributes on html markup wont do anything, so best to include
        it if you want the magic to happen.
      </p>

      <b>The simplest example.</b>

      <p class="py-5">
        Most time, button clicks trigger a javascript event, this might be a server query
        or a modification of the page.  HTMX reduces this complexity to elements on any html
        element.  Check this out:
      </p>

      <div class="py-5">
         &lt;button hx-post=&quot;/clicked&quot; hx-swap=&quot;outerHTML&quot;&gt;<br>
         Click Me <br>
         &lt;/button&gt;<br>
      </div>

      <p class="py-5">
        The hx-post and hx-swap attributes on this button tell htmx:
        <br>
        “When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace
        the entire button with the HTML response”
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
        So much power in so little, I've got this example hooked up right here:
      </p>

      <div class="py-5">
          <button hx-post="/chapter1/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
            Click Me
          </button>
      </div>

      <p class="py-5">
        Of course this needs backend code to work correctly,  You'd need to whip up a simple
        web server that suits your needs.  If you check out the code for this project, you will
        see that it is using "barista", a neat little HTTP server.
      <p>

      <p class="py-5">

      </p>

      <p class="py-5">

      </p>

      <br>


      <div class="py-5">

        <b class="py-5">Motiviation</b>

        <ol class="py-5 list-disc">
          <li>Why should only a and form be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
          <li>Why should only click & submit events trigger them?</li>
          <li>Why should only GET & POST methods be available?</li>
          <li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p class="py-5">
      By removing these arbitrary constraints, htmx completes HTML as hypertext.
      </p>

      <p class="py-5">
      Why does this matter ? Because almost all of the actions you want to do from the
      web client to the server are http verbs, previous locked up behind javascript and json.
