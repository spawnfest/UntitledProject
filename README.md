# Untitled Project - The Cyber Laser Bison Story.


BEAM developers, Are you tired of writing endless lines of JavaScript code just to update your web page dynamically? Do you wish there was a simpler, more magical way to create interactive web applications? You're in luck because HTMX is here to revolutionize your web development experience. ðŸª„âœ¨. 

What is HTMX?

ðŸš€ htmx is not just another web development library; it's pure web development magic! Think of it as your secret potion to create dynamic, interactive, and fast web applications with minimal effort.   No "React" in sight, no frameworks.  We bring the "Hype" back into Hyper Text Markup Language.

## Description

The Untitled Project is ultimately a learning tool.  Its an interactive experience that demonstrates the
unstopable power of using Lisp Flavored Erlang on the backend and HTMX on the front.

Each micro lesson provides both backend and frontend code for the reader to observe and interact with while
not having to setup the full stack in a safe and controlled environment.
